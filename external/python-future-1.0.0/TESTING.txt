A docker image, python-future-builder, is used to do testing and building.  The test suite can be run with: 

    $ bash build.sh

which tests the module under a number of different python versions, where available, or with:

    $ py.test

To execute a single test:

    $ pytest -k test_chained_exceptions_stacktrace
